The NA excercise had me baffled for a bit but I did reason a 
few things out.
1- at the bottom of the code provided there were some lines commented out and 
I just looked to find a relationship between them and it seemed that one showed one of the variables
while the other string, almost exact the same showed the function which in that case was ("destroy")
I figured this had to be the group of funtions governing the accordion.
I made breaks in the code to see what was what. and then I got the accordion to not work
i worked with the function statements and then I opened the minimized file, which has some code all on one line
I normallized this in someting I found called javascript beautifier. 
I compared the original .js and the newly renderred minimized file and couldn't find any difference between it and 
the scripts.js file...but
Since the there must be a command for on and a command for off figuratively speaking and the class is being applied to both
then the modernizer file must have something to do with it I figured.
Now I'm sort of back to square and trying to repeat what Ive done so far and hitting some barriers.
